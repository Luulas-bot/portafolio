      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hey! I’m Lucas Lengyel, currently I’m 20 years old. I born in Argentina and I’m living here as well. I’m currently learning by myself programming. This portafolio is made to show off my projects and how I’ve done them.</p>

<p>I started programming at the beginning of march of this year, 2021. At the moment I’ve done 2 full courses and 3 complete projects by myself. So the question is <em>What do i know now?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>I know Python and how to do a pretty large project on it.</li>
  <li>I learnt SQL through a course that is really good. Therefore I decided to do a large project with SQL and python, wich is the <strong>Film Catalog</strong>.</li>
  <li>While doing these projects I learnt a lot of stuff by mistakes such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Writting the code in a clear way.</li>
      <li>Using variables names that explain what the variables are doing.</li>
      <li>Splitting the code into more files for a better organization.</li>
      <li>Using functions from Python (and other things, like indexes, classes, etc…) to make the code simplier.</li>
      <li>Etc…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I know how to use Git and Github, and how to collaborate with other persons not screwing up the project.</li>
  <li>From the things I learnt from SQL, is remarkable the ways to optimize a Database the course tought me.</li>
  <li>Obviously something about Jekyll, that is what I used to program this Webpage.</li>
  <li>How to do by myself the graphical elements I need for the projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Surely I’m forgetting something, but these things I just mentioned are for sure the most important ones.</p>

<p>Other than programming I adore climbing. I didn’t start climbing long ago, and I’m pretty sure the <em>beginner</em> title fits me perfectly. Anyways, I don’t care that much about at what level am I, I just like climbing.</p>

<h2 id="some-future-projects">Some future projects</h2>
<p>I think that until this point I learnt pretty well the basics of programming, so my next steps will be to go for some more crazy and intresting projects. I’m planning to get into Rust, Java or CSharp (only one at the time) and surely, once I know one of these languages, get into some <em>game dev</em> project, that is what I liked the most from my previous works.</p>

<p>Hope this is useful to know about me a little more. In the main page there are links to go to my Github, or my Instagram. If you want to contact me privatly yo can do through the <a href="linyeravago@gmail.com">linyeravago@gmail.com</a> mail.</p>
